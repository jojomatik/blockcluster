## Building
### Building with `docker-compose` (recommended)
Prerequisites:
- Git
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jojomatik/blockcluster
cd blockcluster
```

**To build for production**, run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.

**To enable hot reloads**, configure a file watcher for the TypeScript files in the `backend/src` directory to run `tsc` in the `backend` directory and run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.

To make sure that the container is recreated and the image rebuilt, use either command with additional options, e.g.:
```sh
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build
```

### Building manually
Prerequisites:
- Git
- Node.js and npm
- TypeScript installed globally (`npm install -g typescript`)

Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jojomatik/blockcluster
cd blockcluster
npm install_all
```

**To build for production**, run the following commands:
```sh
npm run build_all
npm run start
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.


**To enable hot reloads**, configure a file watcher for the TypeScript files in the `backend/src` directory to run `tsc` in the `backend` directory and run the following command:
