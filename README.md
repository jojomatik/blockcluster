## Setup 
### Setup with docker (recommended)
Prerequisites:
- Docker

Customize `/path/to/servers/on/host/machine` and the port directives `-p port:port` to your liking and run:
```sh
docker run -d -v /path/to/servers/on/host/machine:/usr/games/blockcluster/servers -p 8081:8081 25565-25569:25565-25569 jojomatik/blockcluster:latest
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.

### Setup with `docker-compose` (also recommended)
Prerequisites:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Download [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and customize it to your liking and add a volume mount to your servers on the host machine. E.g.:
```
version: "3.9"
services:
  manager:
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
      - 25565:25565
    image: jojomatik/blockcluster
    volumes:
      - /path/to/servers/on/host/machine:/usr/games/blockcluster/servers
```

Then run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.

### Manual setup 
Prerequisites:
- Git
- Node.js and npm
- TypeScript installed globally (`npm install -g typescript`)
- Java (to run the minecraft servers)

1. First build the app using the instructions from ["Building manually"](#building-manually).
2. Either
   - create the `servers/` subdirectory and move your servers into it or
   - set the environment variable `SERVER_PATH` to the relative or absolute path of your servers.
3. Run `npm run start` and open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.


## Building
### Building with `docker-compose` (recommended)
Prerequisites:
- Git
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jojomatik/blockcluster
cd blockcluster
```

**To build for production**, run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.

**To enable hot reloads**, configure a file watcher for the TypeScript files in the `backend/src` directory to run `tsc` in the `backend` directory and run the following command:
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.

To make sure that the container is recreated and the image rebuilt, use either command with additional options, e.g.:
```sh
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build
```

### Building manually
Prerequisites:
- Git
- Node.js and npm
- TypeScript installed globally (`npm install -g typescript`)
- Java (only to run the minecraft servers)

Run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jojomatik/blockcluster
cd blockcluster
npm install
cd backend && npm install
```

**To build for production**, run the following commands:
```sh
npm run build_all
npm run start
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.


**To enable hot reloads**, configure a file watcher for the TypeScript files in the `backend/src` directory to run `tsc` in the `backend` directory and run the following command:
```sh
npm run serve
```
Open `http://[your ip]:8081` in your browser.
